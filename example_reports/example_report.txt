# SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## Executive Summary
The target system (192.168.1.1) presents a MEDIUM overall risk level (Risk Score: 45/100). The scan identified 5 open ports, including standard services like SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443), as well as some non-standard services. The configuration exposes several potential security issues that should be addressed according to the recommendations in this report.

## Technical Analysis

### Port 22 (SSH)
- Service: OpenSSH 7.9
- Status: Open
- Security Implications: SSH provides encrypted remote access to the system. The version detected is relatively current but still may have known vulnerabilities.

### Port 80 (HTTP)
- Service: Apache 2.4.38
- Status: Open
- Security Implications: Unencrypted web traffic could expose sensitive information. The web server should be assessed with specialized web vulnerability scanners.

### Port 443 (HTTPS)
- Service: Apache 2.4.38
- Status: Open
- Security Implications: Encrypted web traffic provides better security than HTTP. Certificate validity and configuration should be verified.

### Port 3306 (MySQL)
- Service: MySQL 5.7.33
- Status: Open
- Security Implications: Database server exposed to network access creates significant risk if not properly secured with strong authentication.

### Port 8080 (HTTP-ALT)
- Service: Unknown
- Status: Open
- Security Implications: Alternative HTTP port could indicate a secondary web application or admin interface with potentially less security oversight.

## Vulnerabilities Assessment

### Medium-Risk Issues:
1. Web servers are exposed and should be assessed for web-specific vulnerabilities
2. Database server (MySQL) is directly accessible from the network
3. Multiple services increasing the attack surface

### Low-Risk Issues:
1. SSH server is running a version that is not the latest but still receives security updates

## Attack Surface Analysis
An attacker could target:
1. Web applications for common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, or SQL Injection
2. Database server for unauthorized access or data extraction
3. SSH for brute force attacks if password authentication is enabled

## Security Recommendations

1. Web Servers:
   - Enable HTTPS with proper certificate configuration
   - Consider implementing a web application firewall
   - Disable HTTP (port 80) in favor of HTTPS-only communication
   - Run a specialized web vulnerability scan

2. Database:
   - Restrict MySQL access to only necessary IPs through firewall rules
   - Ensure strong password policies are in place
   - Consider moving database to internal network not directly accessible

3. SSH:
   - Update to the latest version
   - Disable password authentication in favor of key-based authentication
   - Consider changing the default port for obscurity
   - Implement rate limiting for failed login attempts

## Prioritized Remediation Plan

1. IMMEDIATE: Restrict MySQL access through firewall rules
2. IMMEDIATE: Update SSH configuration to disable password authentication
3. HIGH: Update all services to the latest security patches
4. HIGH: Implement proper HTTPS configuration
5. MEDIUM: Run deeper analysis on web applications
6. MEDIUM: Consider network segmentation to reduce attack surface
